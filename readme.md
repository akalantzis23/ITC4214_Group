This project is developed by Achilleas Kalantzis and Ioanna Skreki for the ITC course at Deere, The American College of Greece. 

This project is a midterm assignment regarding a Grading Table. 

In the web page users can input Course names and Course Grades to be displayed on a table that can short its column and delete each row. 

More specifically:


A) An index page (formatted using a CSS framework of your choice) that should include the following:

	1. A form with 2 fields, where you can add something to the list.

	2. A table of all of the things you've added.

	3. A delete button for each row of the table that lets you remove elements from 
	the list.

	4. A sorting feature, so you can sort entries in the table by a column of your 
	   choice. 

B) an about page (formatted as the index page) with: 
	1. a carousel
	2. grid cards with your names, avatars and short info. 

C) Both pages should: 
	1. Be formatted using a CSS framework of your choice
	2. Be responsive
	3. Have a Sticky Header section with your logo, title and menu for navigation to 
	about page.
	4. Have a footer section with your logo, copy-write information and sample 
	   contact details (social media links etc)
