This project is developed by Achilleas Kalantzis and Ioanna Skreki for the ITC4214 course at Deree, The American College of Greece. 

We developed a project to satisfy the below requirements:

**A) An index page (formatted using a CSS framework of your choice) that should include the following:**

	- A form with 2 fields, where you can add something to the list.

	- A table of all of the things you've added.

	- A delete button for each row of the table that lets you remove elements from 
	the list.

	- A sorting feature, so you can sort entries in the table by a column of your 
	   choice. 

**B) an about page (formatted as the index page) with:**
	- a carousel
	- grid cards with your names, avatars and short info. 

**C) Both pages should:**
	- Be formatted using a CSS framework of your choice
	- Be responsive
	- Have a Sticky Header section with your logo, title and menu for navigation to 
	about page.
	- Have a footer section with your logo, copy-write information and sample 
	   contact details (social media links etc)
